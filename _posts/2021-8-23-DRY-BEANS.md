## Introduction: 

Beans are a key food for much of the world’s population and a key ingredient in traditional recipes worldwide. Dry beans belong to the diverse Fabaceae family,\
sometimes referred to as Leguminosae. Beans are often called by other names, such as legumes or pulses. Yet not all legumes are beans and beans harvested in the\
green state are considered vegetables. Conversely, when harvested in the dried grain state, the edible seeds are called pulses. Beans are known as an economical\
source of protein. In addition, they are low in fat and a rich source of fiber and other important nutrients. Also, they are associated with a wealth of environmental\
and human health benefits, such as improved soil fertility and reduced risk of chronic disease. Dry beans are shelf-stable and can be kept safely at room temperature.\
They should be stored in a food-grade container or bag in a cool, dry, dark place. Warmer temperatures, higher humidity, and longer storage times can all contribute to \
longer cooking times. There are many countries in the world that producing dry bean. India takes the first place in the producing of dry beans, where it produces about 6.4\
million Tonnes. The second place is Myanmar where it produces 5.47 million Tonnes. Then come Brazil, then United State of America, China and many more countries. \

After knowing the importance of the dry bean how we can distinguish between them. There are about 18 kinds of dry beans in the world.\
